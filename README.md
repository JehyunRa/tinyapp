# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

###### Login Page / Register Page
!["login page"](docs/login.png)
This is login page and  can be accesed by clicking 'Log in' on the right side of top nav bar. A user who has an account can enter the app through this page using email and password.

If a user who is not logged in attempts to access a page that isn't register, login, or error page, the user will be redirected back to this page. Also, if a user enters unregistered email or wrong password, the user will be redirected to 403 error page.

Register page has similar layout and it can be accessed by clicking 'Register' on the right side of top nav bar. In register page a user can register new account. However, if the user enters registered email, the user will be redirected to 400 error page.

A user who is logged in cannot access login or register page while logged in as it will redirect the user back to index page, but once logged out will be returned to login page.

###### Index Page
!["index page"](docs/urls_index.png)
This is index page. A user who is logged in can see and access list of urls the user added to the app. By default a new user has no url visible on the list.
